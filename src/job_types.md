# Job types

qq currently supports two job types: `standard` and `loop`.

`standard` jobs are the default type. Any job for which you don't specify a `job-type` when submitting is considered `standard`. Read more about standard jobs [here](standard_job.md).

`loop` jobs automatically submit their continuation before finishing. Read more about them [here](loop_job.md).
