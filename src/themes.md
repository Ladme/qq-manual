# Themes

qq is highly customizable, especially when it comes to the appearance of command output. You can customize qq by creating a `config.toml` file and placing it in `~/.config/qq`.

Several ready-to-use themes are available at: [https://github.com/Ladme/qq/tree/main/themes](https://github.com/Ladme/qq/tree/main/themes)

- **light_terminal** — By default, qq assumes a dark terminal background. On light backgrounds, the default output may look *very* ugly. If you use a light terminal background, you should install this qq theme.

- **traffic_lights_theme** — Adjusts the colors used for job states: running jobs are green (instead of blue), queued jobs are yellow (instead of purple), and finished jobs are blue (instead of green).
