# Installing on sokar

To install qq on the sokar cluster (managed by NCBR), log in to `sokar.ncbr.muni.cz` and run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/Ladme/qq/releases/latest/download/qq-sokar-install.sh | bash
```

This downloads the latest version of qq and installs it to the shared home directory of the cluster nodes.

To complete the installation, open a new terminal or source your `.bashrc` file.
